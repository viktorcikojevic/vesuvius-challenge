# Status

Performing training on step 2. 

# Steps

## Step 1

Make pretraining [vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training.ipynb](vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training.ipynb) by predicting the noise.

## Step 2:

Make training [vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training-step-2.ipynb](vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training-step-2.ipynb) to train the model, starting from the pretrained weights from step 1.

## Step 3

Make training [vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training-step-2-with-augm.ipynb](vesuvius-challenge-3d-resnet-training-step-2-with-augm.ipynb) to train the model, starting from the pretrained weights from step 1, with CutMix data augmentation.
